# Goose-Ducky
A USB rubber ducky payload to run Desktop Goose

Desktop Goose files are not included due to the software developer's wishes. You can download it for free here:

https://samperson.itch.io/desktop-goose

Simply click the "No thanks, just take me to the downloads" button.

Now, unzip the folder and change the relative file path to GooseDesktop/INTERNAL FILES

Delete the FOR MOD MAKERS folder and /assets/sounds/music to reduce the file size

Copy the entire GooseDesktop folder to your USB rubber ducky. 

Copy the payload.dd file. This files is intended for use with picoducky, so change the name/extention as needed.

This code is persistent, with the goose files being copied to the program files, and a startup task being made. Make sure to "clean up" the files post executon or modify the .dd file by deleting the portion commented out, so no startup task is created.

Have fun!
